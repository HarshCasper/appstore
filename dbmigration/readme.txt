These scripts are for migrating changes to the model.
They operate outside of Django and directly interact
with the MySQL database.

To run a script, just type `python scriptname.py'.

Each script has a line for connecting to the MySQL
database. Make sure to modify the login name
and password before running the script.

See comments in each script for a description.
