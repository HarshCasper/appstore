# Cytoscape App Store

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/cytoscape/appstore.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/cytoscape/appstore)

The [Cytoscape App Store](http://apps.cytoscape.org/) is a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) 
web application used to host [Cytoscape Apps](http://manual.cytoscape.org/en/stable/App_Manager.html)


If you'd like to learn about administration procedures, an introduction to 
the code base, and see the full test protocol, visit the __App Store Wiki__ page:

Note that the App Store can also be deployed as a Docker container.
